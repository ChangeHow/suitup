# How to reset/reinstall

Run this command and reset to default zsh config(`.zshrc`)

```shell
sh ./clean.sh
```

This script will do:

1. remove `~/.config/suitup`
2. remove `~/.oh-my-zsh`
3. remove `~/.zshrc`
4. switch to `bash`, _or you can keep `zsh` if you macOS has changed the default shell to zsh_.

# In the end

After doing this, you can enjoy your development journey. ðŸŽ‰
